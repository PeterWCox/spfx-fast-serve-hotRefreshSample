### README 

A simple starter project to get people going with the new 
"hot refresh" functionality for SPFX Fast Serve if people are having trouble getting it to work. 

(For example, I did not put the "hotRefresh" property in the right place and had to check the schema, Doh). Also make sure to run spfx-fast-serve to reflect the latest config.json changes

Any trouble getting it to work feel free to submit an issue or shoot me a message on https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-cox-2a9a71143/
